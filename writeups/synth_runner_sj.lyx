\begin_layout Standard
The Synthetic Control Methodology (SCM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "AG03,ADH10"

\end_inset

 is a data-driven approach to small-sample comparative case-studies for
 estimating treatment effects.
 Similar to a difference-in-differences design, SCM exploits the differences
 in treated and untreated units across the event of interest.
 However, in contrast to a difference-in-differences design, SCM does not
 give all untreated units the same weight in the comparison.
 Instead, it generates a weighted average of the untreated units that closely
 matches the treated unit over the pre-treatment period.
 Outcomes for this synthetic control are then projected into the post-treatment
 period using the weights identified from the pre-treatment comparison.
 This projection is used as the counterfactual for the treated unit.
 Inference is conducted using placebo tests.

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $D_{jt}$
\end_inset

 be an indicator for treatment for unit 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Next, let the observed outcome variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{jt}$
\end_inset

 be the sum of a time-varying treatment effect 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{jt}D_{jt}$
\end_inset

 and the no-treatment counterfactual 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{jt}^{N}$
\end_inset

, which is specified using a factor model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
Y_{jt} & =\alpha_{jt}D_{jt}+Y_{jt}^{N}\label{eq:factor-model}\\
 & =\alpha_{jt}D_{jt}+(\delta_{t}+\mathbf{\theta}_{t}\mathbf{Z}_{j}+\mathbf{\lambda}_{t}\mathbf{\mu}_{j}+\varepsilon_{jt})\nonumber 
\end{align}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 is an unknown time factor, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Z}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $(r\times1)$
\end_inset

 vector of observed covariates unaffected by treatment, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\theta}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $(1\times r)$
\end_inset

 vector of unknown parameters, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\lambda}_{t}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $(1\times F)$
\end_inset

 vector of unknown factors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\mu}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $(F\times1)$
\end_inset

 vector of unknown factor loadings, and the error 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{jt}$
\end_inset

 is independent across units and time with zero mean.
 Letting the first unit be the treated unit, the treatment effect is estimated
 by approximating the unknown 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{1t}^{N}$
\end_inset

 with a weighted average of untreated units 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\hat{\alpha}_{1t} & =Y_{1t}-\sum_{j\geq2}w_{j}Y_{jt}

\begin_layout Standard
Equation
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:factor-model"

\end_inset

 simplifies to the traditional fixed effects equation if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\lambda}_{t}\mathbf{\mu}_{j}=\phi_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 The fixed effects model allows for unobserved heterogeneity that is only
 time-invariant.
 The factor model employed by SCM generalizes this to allow for the existence
 of non-parallel trends between treated and untreated units after controlling
 for observables.

To begin with, let there be a single unit that receives treatment.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}$
\end_inset

 be the number of pre-treatment periods of the 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 total periods.
 Index units 
\begin_inset Formula $\{1,\ldots,J+1\}$
\end_inset

 such that the first unit is the treated unit and the others are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}_{j}$
\end_inset

 be (
\begin_inset Formula $T\times1$
\end_inset

) the vector of outcomes for unit 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}_{0}$
\end_inset

 be the (
\begin_inset Formula $T\times J$
\end_inset

) matrix of outcomes for all donors.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{W}$
\end_inset

 be a 
\begin_inset Formula $(J\times1)$
\end_inset

 observation-weight matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $(w_{2},w_{3},\ldots,w_{J+1})'$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=2}^{J+1}w_{j}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}\geq0\ \forall j\in\{2,\ldots,J+1\}$
\end_inset

.
 A weighted average of donors over the outcome is constructed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}_{0}\mathbf{W}$
\end_inset

.
 Partition the outcome into pre-treatment and post-treatment vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}_{j}=(\overleftarrow{\mathbf{Y}}_{j}\backslash\overrightarrow{\mathbf{Y}}_{j})$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 represent a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 pre-treatment characteristics (
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 This includes 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Z}$

\end_inset

 linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\overleftarrow{\mathbf{Y}}$

\begin_inset Formula $k=r+M$
\end_inset

 Analogously, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}_{0}$

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V}$
\end_inset

 be a 
\begin_inset Formula $(k\times k)$
\end_inset

 variable-weight matrix indicating the relative significance of the predictor
 variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

, estimation of SCM consists of finding the optimal weighting matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{W}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V}$
\end_inset

.
 For a given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{W}$
\end_inset

 is picked to minimize the root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) of
 the predictor variables, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \mathbf{X}_{1}-\mathbf{X}_{0}\mathbf{W}\right\Vert _{\mathbf{V}}$
\end_inset

.
 In this way, the treated unit and its synthetic control look similar along
 dimensions that matter for predicting pre-treatment outcomes.
 The inferential procedure is valid for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V}$
\end_inset

, but 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 suggest that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V}$
\end_inset

 be picked to minimize the prediction error of the pre-treatment outcome
 between the treated unit the synthetic control.
 Define distance measures 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \mathbf{A}\right\Vert _{\mathbf{B}}=\sqrt{\mathbf{A}'\mathbf{B}\mathbf{A}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \mathbf{A}\right\Vert =\sqrt{\mathbf{A}'\textrm{cols}(\mathbf{A})^{-1}\mathbf{A}}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\Vert \overleftarrow{\mathbf{Y}}_{1}-\overleftarrow{\mathbf{Y}}_{0}\mathbf{W}\right\Vert $
\end_inset

 is then the pre-treatment RMSPE with a given weighted average of the control
 units.
 Define this as 
\begin_inset Formula $\overleftarrow{s}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and define 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{s}_{1}$
\end_inset

 as the post-treatment RMSPE\SpecialChar endofsentence

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{W}$
\end_inset

 is a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{V}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If weights can be found such that the synthetic control matches the treated

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{t=1}^{T_{0}}\mathbf{\lambda}_{t}'\mathbf{\lambda}_{t}$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}_{1}$

\begin_layout Subsection
Inference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After estimating the effect, statistical significance is determined by running
 placebo tests.
 Estimate the same model on each untreated unit, assuming it was treated
 at the same time, to get a distribution of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in-place
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 placebo effects.
 Disallow the actual treated unit from being considered for the synthetic
 controls of these other units.
 If the distribution of placebo effects yields many effects as large as
 the main estimate, then it is likely that the estimated effect was observed
 by chance.
 This non-parametric, exact test has the advantage of not imposing any distribut
ion on the errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the estimated effect for a particular post-treatment period
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}_{1t}$
\end_inset

 and that the distribution of corresponding in-place placebos is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}_{1t}^{PL}=\{\hat{\alpha}_{jt}:j\neq1\}$
\end_inset

.
 The two-sided 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-value is then 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p\textrm{-value} & =\Pr\left(|\hat{\alpha}_{1t}^{PL}|\geq|\hat{\alpha}_{1t}|\right)\\
 & =\frac{\sum_{j\neq1}1(|\hat{\alpha}_{jt}|\geq|\hat{\alpha}_{1t}|)}{J}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

and the one-sided 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-values (for positive effects) are 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
p\textrm{-value} & =\Pr\left(\hat{\alpha}_{1t}^{PL}\geq\hat{\alpha}_{1t}\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 unit.
 Confidence intervals can be constructed by inverting the 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}_{1t}$
\end_inset

 Care should be taken with these, however.
 As noted by

To gauge the joint effect across all post-treatment periods 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 suggest using post-treatment RMSPE 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{s}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{s}_{1}$
\end_inset

 would be compared to the corresponding 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{s}_{1}^{PL}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The placebo effects may be quite large if those units where not matched
 well in the pre-treatment period.
 This would cause 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-values to be too conservative.
 To control for this, one may want to adjust 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}_{jt}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{s}_{j}$
\end_inset

 for the quality of the pre-treatment matches.
 Adjustment can be achieved by two mechanisms:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Restricting the comparison set of control effects to only include those
 that match well.
 This is done by setting a multiple 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and removing all placebos 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\overleftarrow{s}_{j}>m\overleftarrow{s}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dividing all effects by the corresponding pre-treatment match quality 
\begin_inset Formula $\overleftarrow{s}$
\end_inset

 to get standardized (studentized) measures: 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{\hat{\alpha}_{jt}}{\overleftarrow{s_{j}}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{\overrightarrow{s}_{j}}{\overleftarrow{s}_{j}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inference can then be conducted over four quantities (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}_{jt},\overrightarrow{s}_{j},\nicefrac{\hat{\alpha}_{jt}}{\overleftarrow{s_{j}}},\nicefrac{\overrightarrow{s}_{j}}{\overleftarrow{s}_{j}}$
\end_inset

 counterfactual.
 The first is to check if a weighted average of donors is able to approximate
 the treated unit in the pre-treatment.
 This should be satisfied if the treated unit lies within the convex hull
 of the control units.
 One can visually compare the difference in pre-treatment outcomes between
 a unit and its synthetic control.
 Additionally one could look at the distribution of pre-treatment RMSPE's
 and see what proportion of control units have values at least as high as
 that of the treated unit.

 This syntax (used by

 Since synthetic control methods split time into pre-treatment and treated

 is the first of the treated periods and, slightly confusingly, also called
 post-treatment.

 Diagnostics of the fit for the validation period will be outputted.
 If the value is between 0 and 1, there will be at least one training period

The 
\family typewriter
e(pval_joint_post)
\family default
 lists the proportion of effects from control units that have post-treatment
 RMSPE at least as great as the treated unit.
 While it is no quite significant at the 10 percent level, it does not take
 into account pre-treatment match quality.
 The 
\family typewriter
e(pval_joint_post_std)
\family default
 value lists the same proportion, but scales all values by the relevant
 pre-treatment RMSPE\SpecialChar endofsentence
 This measure does show significance.
 The final measure, 
\family typewriter
e(avg_pre_rmspe_p)
\family default
, is a diagnostic measure and it notes that the treated unit was matched
 better than the majority of the control units.
 If the treatment is considered truly at random then the true 
\begin_inset Formula $p$

-value is a modification that adds one to the numerator and denominator
 (in cases with a single treatment).
 This is shown for the case of the ratio of post- to pre-treatment RMSPE\SpecialChar endofsentence

Again there is a single treatment period, so synthetic control data can
 be merged into our main dataset.
 In this setting we (a) specify the treated units/periods with a binary
 variable, (b) generate the outcome predictors automatically using the initial
 13 periods of the pre-treatment era (the rest is the "validation" period),
 (c) we match on trends, and (d) during inference we limit the control units
 to those with pre-treatment match quality no more than 10 times worse than
 the match quality of the corresponding treatment units.
 Now that we have a training/validation period split there is a new diagnostic.
 It shows that 84% of the control units have a worse match (a higher RMSPE)
 during the validation period.
 The graphing commands are equivalent.
 The ones showing the range of effects and raw data are shown in Figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 One can see that all the lines converge on the last pre-treatment period
 as that is the unit that all are standardized by (and all the synthetic
 controls then match their real units and have zero prediction error).

We extend Example 2 by considering a control state now to be treated (Georgia
 in addition to California).
 Note that no treatment actually happened in Georgia in 1987.
 This is just to illustrate additional usage options.
 With several treatment periods we can not automatically include all the
 synthetic control outputs back into the main dataset.
 Some of the graphs (of 
\family typewriter
single_treatment_graphs
\family default
) can also no longer be made.
 The 
\family typewriter
effect_graphs
\family default
 are shown in Figure

 generated for the underlying

The Synthetic Control Methodology (SCM) 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 allows researchers to quantitatively estimate effects in many small sample
 settings in a manner grounded by theory.
 This article provides an overview of the theory of SCM and the

 provides tools to help with the common tasks of estimating a synthetic
 control model.
 It automates the process of conducting in-place placebos and calculating
 inference on the various possible measures.
 Following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "CGNP13"

\end_inset

 it (a) extends the initial estimation strategy to allow for multiple units
 that receive treatment (at potentially different times), (b) allows for
 matching on trends in the outcome variable rather than on the level, and
 (c) automates the process of splitting pre-treatment periods into

 sections.
 It also provides graphs of diagnostics, inference, and estimate effects.
